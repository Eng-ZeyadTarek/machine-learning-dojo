# Music-Classification-using-ANN

To illustrate the basic concepts, we will look at a relatively simple music classification problem.  Given a sample of music, we want to determine which instrument (e.g. trumpet, violin, piano) is playing.  This dataset was generously supplied by [Prof. Juan Bello](http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/faculty/Juan_Pablo_Bello) at NYU Stenihardt  and his former PhD student Eric Humphrey (now at Spotify).  They have a complete website dedicated to deep learning methods in music informatics:
