# lab_robot_calib_partial.ipynb
I will illustrate the use of multiple linear regression for calibrating robot control, and we will focus on predicting the current draw into one of the joints as a function of the robot motion.  Such models are essential in predicting the overall robot power consumption.  Several other models could also be used.
